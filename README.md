I created two html pages
1 - forgot_password.html: linked from "Forgot password?" on the Login page for users to enter their email to reset their password
2 - reset_password.html: page link sent to users email for them to fill in order to reset their password.
changed my readme to md from txt


added navbar to landing page and dashboard 

note that only dashboard.php has the log out link on the navbar
